    <h1>W3 Servers Software</h1>
    <p>A <un>W3</un> server, like the ftp daemon , is a program which responds to an incoming tcp connection and provides a service to the caller.There are many varieties of W3 server software to serve different forms of data.
    </p>
    <h2>The basic daemon</h2>
    <p>The basic W3 daemon program serves files already in hypertext or plain text. This daemon then is used as a basis for many other types of server and gateway. Documentation includes:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>
            <dd>*User guid .</dd>
            <dd>Internals --a desription of the code.</dd>
        </dt>
    </dl>
    <p>Much of the above may also apply in whole or part to other servers mentioned below. Whatever server you are running, you will probably be interested in:

    <dl>
        <dt>
            <dd>* Tools for information providers</dd>
        </dt>
    </dl>
    <h2>Making a new server</h2>
    <p>This daemon is often used as a basis for a more specific server for a given application. A server which allows a world of data to be seen as part of the W3 universe is known as a gateway. (Most servers could therefore be regarded as gateways, but the term implies some conversion or mapping between dissimilar worlds) . For short tutorials with examples, see:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>
            <dd>* Writing a srver in C</dd>
            <dd>* Writing a server as a script </dd>

        </dt>
    </dl>
    <p>It is a good idea to pick the basic daemon or one of the servers below as a starting point when making a new server.
    </p>
    <h2>Other servers and Gateways</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>These are servers which provide data extracted from other systems. they are built using code from the basic daemon, or scripts.</dt>
        <dt>FIND gateway</dt>
        <dd>for CERN/VM XFIND which calls a REXX exec to get the information from the XFIND system running on the CERNVM mainframe.</dd>
        <dt>VMS Help gateway</dt>
        <dd>This allows any VMS help files to be made available to WWW clients. Runs on VAX/VMS.
        </dd>
        <dt>WAISGate</dt>
        <dd>A gateway to information available using the W.A.I.S. protocol.</dd>
        <dt>DCLServer</dt>
        <dd>A server for VMS systems which allows you to write a gateway to your own favorite information system using DCL.</dd>
        <dt>System33</dt>
        <dd>A (big) csh script server providing data including Xerox System33 documents, man pages in plain text, phone numbers, etc. etc...!
        </dd>
        <dt>Oracle</dt>
        <dd>A generic server to oracle. Could be used as a basis for gateways to specific Oracle databases.</dd>
        <dt>Geography</dt>
        <dd>Gateway to the</dd>
