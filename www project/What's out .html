    <h1>General Overview</h1>
    <p>There is no "top" to the World-Wide Web. You can look at it from many points of view. If you have no other bias, here are some ways of looking for information.
    </p>
    <p>by Subject</p>
    <p>A classification by subject of interest. Incomplete but easiest to use.</p>
    <P>by Type</P>
    <p>Looking by type of service (access protocol, etc) may allow to find things if you know what you are looking for.
    </p>
    <p>If you have to use a "top" node, we recommend either this node or the subject list. See also:<a href ="index.html" >About the W3 project</a>.</p>
