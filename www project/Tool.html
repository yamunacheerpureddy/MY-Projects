    <h1>W3 Tools</h1>
    <p>These tools aid managements of W3 servers, generation of hypertext, etc.</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>W3 basic daemon</dt>
        <dd>Part of the W3 project code</dd>
        <dt>Gateway servers</dt>
        <dd>which you can take and adapt.</dd>
        <dt>Framemaker interface</dt>
        <dl>There are some tar files on the anonymous FTP archive on
        file://info.cern.ch/www/src which allow FRAMEmaker to be used as a W3 tool. Dan Conolly, Convex. Incldues MIF HTML translation.
        Making HTML into TeX</dl>
        <dd>We did this with the "WWW Book" to print it. See the Makefile for example, and the scripts html2latex.sed and sub1.sed. We wrote a special introduction, but otherwise all the text was hypertext from the W3 project.</dd>
        <dt>Generating HTML</dt>
        <dd>These are scripts for generating SGML hypertext from things like directory listings, etc. Also, for checking and correcting dubious HTML.
            Server log analysis</dd>
            <dd>Analysing server logs requires first of all changing the numeric internet node numebrs into domain names. httpd-analyse.c is a program to do that. Feed the results through awk and grep of your choice!
